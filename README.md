-  Hi, I’m @KNFLD
-  I’m interested in ... ppooll for Max MSP
-  Here you can find all my ports and acts for ppooll, feel free to use and edit as you wish.

-  any ports/borrowed patches will state the developers within the main act subpatch.

-  some acts may present errors with newer versions of ppooll.

   some ports here will require the following packages:
   -

- ts.ingran/ts.grantap. = TS.modular


- gf.graindelay/gf.sustain = Grainflow


- rnbo_@'s = RNBO Pedal Package



- How to reach me ... knfld@outlook.com or via THE PPOOLL discord channel!
