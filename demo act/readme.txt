demo act: is a act for ppooll that you can transplant your own patches into and make them into your own act, simply transplant and encapsulate the patch into a subpatch and replace the dummy subpatch, then for quickness you can unselect any sliders dials when encapsulating then arrange and save the act, for more advance users you can encasulate everything then any sliders and dials can be turned into ppooll sliders (using ll_number) this makes the parameters subpatched talk to the ppooll network allowing them to be controlled from other acts ie modul.ator etc.

bare in mind ppooll 8.2 onwards requires multichannel support you can make your patch support mulichannel using mc.unpack/mc.pack objects.
(in some cases this will fix issues with acts being mono)

*when you open demo to make a act start by showing the titlebar (click on act name select titlebar) then you want to click "file" then "SAVE AS" saving it with the name of your act, this will make a save of your new act in the ppooll.acts folder and will not not overwrite the original demo act for later act building*

have fun patching and please share your own acts to #act share in the ppooll discord group.
